# Lifecycle

## Init

Init:

1. Finalizes an unfinished previous scenario without stopping a reusable CARLA
   process.
2. Stores output directory, config, and `dt`.
3. Validates config and the PCLA registry name.
4. Starts CARLA when configured.
5. Retries connection within one total timeout.
6. Clears stale dynamic actors from a reused world.

Large PCLA models are not imported or loaded during constructor or Init.

## Reset

Reset:

1. Finalizes the previous PCLA instance and wrapper actors.
2. Validates map name, initial ego observation, and goal.
3. Loads `<xodr_root>/<map_name>.xodr`.
4. Reuses the generated world when the map/path match and reuse is enabled.
5. Spawns the wrapper-owned ego.
6. Applies synchronous/no-rendering settings and `InitRequest.dt`.
7. Configures `CarlaDataProvider`.
8. Validates or atomically generates route XML.
9. Loads the PCLA model and its sensors.
10. Runs the initial observation through the normal Step path.

Any partial failure triggers cleanup before the exception is returned.

## Step

Step requires a non-empty observation with ego first. It:

1. Synchronizes ego and non-ego shadow actors.
2. Ticks or waits for CARLA exactly once.
3. Gets one snapshot.
4. Updates `CarlaDataProvider`.
5. Passes that same snapshot to PCLA/GameTime.
6. Returns `THROTTLE_STEER_BREAK`.

PCLA exceptions set the fatal quit message and are not converted to normal zero
control. A `None` action follows `action_none_timeout_seconds`.

## Ownership

| Resource | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| CARLA process | Wrapper only when it launched the process |
| Ego actor | Wrapper |
| Observation-controlled non-ego actors | Wrapper |
| PCLA real and pseudo sensors | Current PCLA instance |
| Generated route file | Current reset output directory |

Cleanup forces the world asynchronous and clears fixed delta time before actor
destruction. It does not delete traffic lights, static props, unrelated
sensors, or externally owned CARLA processes.

## ShouldQuit And Stop

ShouldQuit reports:

- route endpoint reached,
- owned CARLA process exit and return code,
- fatal PCLA error,
- finalized/stopped state.

Stop is idempotent. It cleans the PCLA agent/sensors, wrapper actors, and an
owned CARLA process, then releases client/world/model references.
